# HarperDB Custom Functions Demo Project

This project was created for the HarperDB Custom Functions demo.

This repo contains two directories: one comprised of the routes and static UI, and the other containing the source files for the static UI.

We keep them separate to reduce the deployment size of the Custom Functions Project folder.

Each folder has its own README file, linked below:

- [Custom Functions Project README](./dogs/README.md)
- [Custom Functions UI Source README](./static_ui_src/README.md)
