# HarperDB Custom Functions Demo UI Source

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Aside from the content in App.js and App.css, nothing has been changed from the basic CRA template.

## Get Started

---

### `yarn`

Install project dependencies.


### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

It then copies the contents of the build folder into the `static` folder of the `dogs` project.\
You may need to edit the directory in package.json > scripts > build if your `custom_functions` folder isn't located at `~/hdb/custom_functions`
